*a, Schematic of the recording system for Drosophila. b, Example image and magnified views of the 17-Drosophila dataset. Scale bar, 5 mm. c, Projected trajectories of the 17 Drosophila during the entire recording period. d, Velocity (left) and acceleration (right) of all 17 Drosophila averaged over 0.2-s intervals as a function of time.  Lines and shaded region denote mean and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. e, 3D (x-y-t) trajectories of the 17 Drosophila in 100 seconds. The trajectories of two chasing Drosophila are shown separately in the inset. The frame rate of the 17-Drosophila dataset is 54 Hz and the total number of frames is 26,900.*

*a, Example image of the 7-C. elegans dataset. Scale bar, 300 Î¼m. b, Velocity of all of 7 C. elegans averaged over 10-s intervals as a function of time. Lines and shaded region denote mean and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The frame rate of the 7-C. elegans dataset is 10 Hz and the total number of frames is 13,550 frames. c, Directional change frequency of seven C. elegans. The directional change frequency was averaged over 20-s intervals. d. Comparing the performance of UDMT with other tracking methods on all C. elegans and Drosophila datasets. The number of animals is indicated at the bottom of each bar plot. The bars represent mean values and error whiskers represent 98% confidence intervals. N=5 for all datasets and each black point indicates a sample. N/A means that DLC fails to track Drosophila datasets.*

*The interaction of two Betta splendens (betta fish) in the same arena is continuously recorded (51 Hz frame rate, 15,020 frames). Their swimming trajectories were extracted using UDMT. a, Projected trajectories of the two betta fish during the entire recording period. b, 3D (x-y-t) trajectories of the two betta fish in a 300-second time window. The trajectories during chasing are shown separately in the inset. c, Velocity of the two betta fish. Traces were averaged over 10 frames. The purple shaded area indicates the time of confrontation, during which the speed of both animals decreased to nearly zero. The blue shaded area indicates the time of chasing, when the speed of the escaping fish (ID 2) increased rapidly. d, Representative video frames showing the confrontation and chasing behavior of the two betta fish. The tracks show the movement of the two betta fish over 1.5 seconds. Scale bar, 20 mm.*
